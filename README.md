### Developing Data Products - Assignment - part 1

## simAppCoursera

**This simple Shiny app is created for the first part of the course project of Developing Data Products, and deployed on the RStudio's server.**

This simple Shiny application is based on the simulation exercise" of another Coursera course, *Statistical Inference*. In this app, we may play with the [exponential distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution) and compare it with the [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem). Through simulation, we may view the basic properties of the distribution of the mean of a specified number of exponentials.
